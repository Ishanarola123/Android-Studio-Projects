        <p style="font-weight:bold;">What are comments and why we use them and In what way they will affect the program?</p>
        <span class="headings">Answer:</span><br/>
        Comments are written to indicate the use of a particular statement why we are wrting it in our code so that even a non coder can easily understand why the statement is written inside the program
        Ex.printf("Hello world"); //To print "Hello World" on console
        int name; // Used to store name of a person

        See how easier it will be to understand if we use comments in our code.
        Comments are not executed as they are ignored by compiler while running a program so they won't affect the program in any way unless you mistype :)
