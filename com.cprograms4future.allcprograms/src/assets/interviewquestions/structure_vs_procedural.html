        Structural Programming:-
        These are based on the top down methodology in which a system is further divided into subsystem these are Typically Called as Functions<br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Top down analysis for problem solving: It focuses on dividing the problem into sub parts and hence simplifies the problem solving.
            </li>
            <li>
                Modularization for program structure and organization: It organizes large instructions by breaking them into separate and smaller section of modules, sub routines and subprograms.
            </li>
            <li>
                Structured code for the individual modules Control structures are used to determine the exact order in which the set of instructions are to be executed.
            </li>
            <li>
                By Introducing Modularity maintaining of Code and Debugging of Codes is became Easy.and Readability of Code also Increased.
            </li>
        </ul><br>
        C is structured Programming
        <br>
        Procedural Programming:-
        These languages programs in such a way that the program executes statement by statement, reading and modifying a shared memory.the program communicate with the OS are through a set of procedure, or function, which in turn is a group of specific instructions executed one after the other. The data was quite
        separate from the procedures and the challenge was to keep track of the order in which the functions are called and what data was changed.

        Ex: Pascal, Fortran , COBOL<br>
