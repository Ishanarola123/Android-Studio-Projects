        <span class="headings">Question:</span><br/>
        <p style="font-weight:bold;">What is conio.h and getch() and clrscr()?</p>
        <span class="headings">Answer:</span><br/>
        "conio" means console input and output and "getch()" is defined in "conio.h".<br />
        getch() is used to freeze the console screen for user input.It will read a character as input.<br />
        <br />
        Now a days we are getting compilers which will show output after running a program without closing the console after displaying output so no need to use getch().<br />
        If you check in all the programs in this App doesn't have clrscr() at starting of the programs and getch() at the end of the program.<br />
        Since when you run the program again previous output will be cleared automatically so there is no need of using clrscr().<br />
        <br />
        But in TURBO-C compiler this is not the case.As soon as output is displayed it will close the console.<br />
        So just to avoid it we write getch() at the end of program which makes console waits for user inputing any character.<br />
        And it won't clear the previous output on console without clrscr() at the starting of program.<br>
