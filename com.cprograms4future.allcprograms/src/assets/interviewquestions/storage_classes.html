        <p style="font-weight:bold;">What are storage classes in C?</p>
        <span class="headings">Answer:</span><br/>
        1.Automatic Storage Class--Whenever a variable is declared this storage class is added by default whose scope is only inside a function or block<br>
        They have a <u>garbage</u> value by default<br><br>
        2.Static Storage Class---Their default value is zero and they have ability to store value even though they are out of scope as they are not redeclared when ever they appear<br>
                                  Check the example of Voting system under storage classes in this App<br><br>
        3.External Storage Class--When we declare a variable as extern then it is available globally through out the program.<br>Simply to tell it is also a global variable but can be declared inside a function also<br>
        <br>
        4.Register Storage Class--These are used when we are using a variable more number of times to reduce execution time.<br>
        Usually these varibles are stored in the register of a processor which makes it to be accessible faster then normal variables.<br>
