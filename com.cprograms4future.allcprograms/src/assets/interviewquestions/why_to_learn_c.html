        <p style="font-weight:bold;">Why to Learn C?</p>
        <span class="headings">Answer:</span><br/>
       <ul> <li>Easy to understand and learn</li>
           <li>Most devices require to run fast and need less space which makes them to choose C as the languange to build their applications like in embedded C,mobile devices,mostly games for PC where they chose C as main core programming language etc,</li>
           <li>Building Blocks to learn other programming languages.</li>
           <li>Device drivers of new devices are always written in C. The reason is that C provides you access to the basic elements of the computer. It gives you direct access to memory of your CPU through pointers. It allows you to manipulate and play with bits and bytes.</li>
           <li>Major parts of the Windows, Unix and Linux are still written in C.</li>
           <li>It is middle level language so that User can use c language to do System Programming (for writing operating system) as well as Application Programming (for generate menu driven customer billing system )</li>
